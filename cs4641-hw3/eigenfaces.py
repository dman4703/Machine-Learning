        Given a dataset and a collection of eigenfaces,
        project each image in the dataset onto the eigenfaces.

        Recall that the eigenfaces were built off of centered data.
        This has functional usage, since you can't be certain that
        your test data will have the same brightness as your train data.
        Thus, again, subtract the mean.

        While we won't check for looping,
        you may experience timeouts for slow solutions.

            data: (M, D) numpy array where each row is a flattened face image.
