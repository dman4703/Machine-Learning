Brief overview of the concepts explored in each assignment folder (see the corresponding HW*.tex for full prompts).

- `cs4641-hw1` (HW1.tex)
  - Linear algebra: determinants, inverses, eigenvalues/eigenvectors
  - Probabilities: expectation, covariance, correlation, independence
  - Optimization: KKT conditions; maximum likelihood (discrete, exponential)
  - Information theory: entropy, mutual information proofs; basic algorithmic complexity
- `cs4641-hw2` (HW2.tex)
  - Clustering: KMeans/KMeans++, clustering metrics, hierarchical clustering
  - Density models: EM algorithm, Gaussian Mixture Models (sampling, image compression)
