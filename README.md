Brief overview of the concepts explored in each assignment folder (see the corresponding HW*.tex for full prompts).

- `cs4641-hw1` (HW1.tex): linear algebra basics (determinants, inverses, eigenvalues), expectation/covariance/correlation and independence, KKT optimization, maximum likelihood for discrete and exponential models, information theory (mutual information and entropy proofs), simple algorithmic complexity plus extra probability proofs.
- `cs4641-hw2` (HW2.tex): unsupervised learning with KMeans/KMeans++ and clustering metrics, EM algorithm foundations, Gaussian Mixture Models (including sampling and image compression), hierarchical clustering, and semi-supervised messy-data cleaning via KNN and EM.
- `cs4641-hw3` (HW3.tex): SVD for audio compression and recommender systems, PCA eigenfaces, polynomial regression and ridge regularization with GD/SGD/MBGD and cross-validation, Naive Bayes and logistic regression for text sentiment, feature selection (forward/backward), and handling class imbalance with ROC/AUC and SMOTE.
- `cs4641-hw4` (HW4.tex): two-layer neural networks with softmax/softsign, dropout, cross-entropy loss, backprop, and GD/mini-batch/Adam training; CNN-based image classification with augmentation/regularization; SVMs with custom and RBF kernels; and sequence modeling with RNN/LSTM for next-character prediction.
