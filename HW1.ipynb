All materials submitted must be your own, and you must not collaborate with anyone or share your HW content except the ML instructional team.\n","\n","* <font color='darkred'>Working with a generative-AI platform _may constitute plagiarism_.</font> In line with the Joyner Heuristic being used by many classes at GT, you should treat collaboration with generative-AI as collaboration with a knowledgeable peer. <font color='darkred'>**Sharing the question or your work verbatim with an AI agent so as to generate an answer to the question is considered academic dishonesty and will be treated the same as any other incident of academic dishonesty.**</font> If you find yourself turning to generative-AI for help answering a question, we suggest that you instead make use of Ed or TA office hours.\n","\n","* <font color='darkred'>Even using generative-AI for formatting your answers is _not permitted_. **While we understand that \\LaTeX~has a learning curve, you may not use any generative-AI platform to improve your writing or LaTeX formatting.**</font> These tools inherently produce output that may include a partial or complete solution to the question, including corrections to work you give it, even if purely prompted for syntactic use. Additionally, you have no custody over the data you give these platforms, which may leak or be used to inform subsequent training. Thus, while you are more than welcome to ask it about LaTeX commands and formatting tips, sharing the question or your answer to a question verbatim with an AI agent, even purely for syntactic use, is considered academic dishonesty and will be treated the same as any other incident of academic dishonesty. If you find yourself turning to generative-AI for help rewording your work to improve the language therein, remember that many of these questions will not be graded on language, but the content of your work. If you wish to improve it nonetheless, you can make use of the [Georgia Tech Communications Lab](https://www.communicationcenter.gatech.edu/) or TA office hours. If you find yourself turning to generative-AI for help reformatting your LaTeX, we suggest that you instead use the resources in the instructions below or TA office hours. Ed is also an appropriate place to ask about LaTeX formatting, so long as your post doesn't reveal answers to a question (or make a private post if your question necessitates revealing answers).\n","\n","* <font color='darkred'>_All_ incidents of suspected dishonesty, plagiarism, or violations of the Georgia Tech Honor Code will be subject to the institute’s Academic Integrity procedures. **If we observe any (even small) similarities/plagiarisms detected by Gradescope or our TAs, we will directly report the case to OSI, which may, unfortunately, lead to a very harsh outcome, pending review. Consequences can be severe, including academic probation or dismissal, grade penalties, a 0 grade for assignments concerned, and prohibition from withdrawing from the class.**</font>"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"uI6nZBMF_Mvw","tags":[]},"source":["## Instructions for the assignment\n","\n","<!-- No changes needed on the below section -->\n","- This assignment consists of warm-up programming questions designed to get you familiar with our programming homework structure."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"g7stIuyo_Mvx"},"source":["## Using the autograder\n","\n","- Grads will typically find three assignments on Gradescope and Undergrads will typically find four assignments:\n","    - \"Assignment X Non-programming\": Where you will submit the written portion of the assignment.\n","    - \"Assignment X Programming\": Where you will submit any .py files and any program outputs as required by the problem.\n","    - \"Assignment X Programming - Bonus for All\": Where you will submit any .py files and any program outputs as required for Bonus for All.\n","    - \"Assignment X Programming - Bonus for Undergrad\": Where you will submit any .py files and any program outputs as required for Bonus for Undergrand.
